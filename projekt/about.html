    <p>
      I have been working in the development of various companies for 8 years at
      the same tima as contraction of system. It is a job that I enjoy very
      well, but I feel ready to take another step in my career. Johnson &
      Johnson is also a company that I have heard very well about, which causes
      my interest in working with you.

    <p id="texthead1">
      In my current experience I have been responsible for some 10 projects with
      10 - 140 people involved. A typical project includes people from several
      departments of the company, for example. Sellers, designers and
      it-designers as well as representatives from our customers, mainly in
      financial services and insurance. I am an educated economist, and
      previously worked as a production developer, avd have deep expertise in
      economics and development. During my previous, i have attended courses in
      project management, finance, communication and leadership, witch have
      helped me feel secure in my previous role, although of course i can
      develop further witch I am sure I can do with in the company.
